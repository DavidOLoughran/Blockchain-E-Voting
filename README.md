# Blockchain E-Voting Web Application

## Project Overview

This project has been designed by me for the module Applied Project and Dissertation with the intention of creating a Semi Decentralised Online Voting System built with the latest in blockchain technology. The project should allow users to register and login to their dashboard where they can create and participate in in online lections and polls.
The main purpose of this project is to utilise blockchain technology and smart contracts as an immutable database providing tamper free voting functionality to give users the comfort of knowing their votes are secure. The project will also utilise React on the front-end to create a simplistic and intuitive web application to improve the user’s experience. 
This project will utilise the latest in blockchain development to improve user onboarding by removing the need for users the pay gas fees when interacting with a decentralised application while combining web 2 registration/logins with secure web 3 wallet functionality as a form of two factor authentication to improve account security.
I plan to use this project to show case the developer skills I have learned throughout my study and expand my knowledge into the world of decentralised applications. I plan to improve my skills of adapting new and evolving technologies such as utilising smart contract to combine standard frameworks with blockchain based decentralised application’s.  

## Project Features
- User can register and login to their account
- Metamask is utilised as 2FA to verify the user (Linked after signup)
- User can create elections secured by the Polygon Blockchain Network
- User can participate in elections where they have been added as a voter
- User can participate in public polls 
- User can participate and view all polls in decending order of most popular
- User session is remembered but if the browser is closed they will be required to re-login into to Metamask to access their account
